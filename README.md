Theory and Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

## [Data Structures](data-structures/data-structures.md)

Data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.

1. Arrays
2. Matrix
3. Lists
4. Tuples
5. Sets
6. Maps
7. Linked List
8. Stacks
9. Queues
10. Hash tables
11. Binary Trees
12. Binary Search Trees
13. Heaps
14. Graphs

## [Algorithms](algorithms/algorithms.md)

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

1. Divide and Conquer
2. Recursion
3. Backtracking
4. Tree Traversal
5. Sorting
6. Searching
7. Graphs
8. Algorithm Analysis
9. Big-O Notation
10. Algorithm classes
